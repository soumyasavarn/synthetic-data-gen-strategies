Datasets:
---------
Image dataset on which Pix2Pix is trained on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/defileroff/comic-faces-paired-synthetic-v2

For tabular data I am not pretraining because it can be done on the fly. Still, I analysed ML performance boost on 
`iris` dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris.

Another dataset is provided in the testing_data folder (to be used in the app/frontend).
